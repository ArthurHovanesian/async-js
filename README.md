# async-js

Author: Shi-Hao Hong (@shihaohong)

This repository is created to help practice the use of callbacks through the use of the 'fs' Node module.

How to use repo:
First, read the comments in async-all-word-count.js. Then, look at input.txt to see what your input file is and then at the exampleOutput directory to see what your resulting data should look like if done correctly. Implement the `countAllWords` function so that you take the input.txt file and create a new .txt file that is identical to the sampleOutput.txt file.
